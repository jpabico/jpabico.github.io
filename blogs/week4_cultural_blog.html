                  I spent a third of my teaching career teaching at a small, 
                  private high school that mostly catered to students with
                  learning disabilities or special emotional needs.  It was
                  often the case that my lesson plans had to be adjusted to accommodate the students.  Ninety-nine percent of the time, these accommodations had merit and were warranted.  But there were a few students that every once in a while abused the priviledges that were given to them.  One student in particular, "Mike" (real name not used), was diagnosed with motivation deficiency disorder.  Mike never had the slightest interest in what was being taught in class or what sort of activities we were doing.  This in and of itself was nothing unique (not all high school students enjoy linear equations!).  Due to his lack of interest in many things, part of his accommodations included being able to pursue whatever few interests he had whenever it struck his fancy, to encourage him to develop a passion for something (and get motivation).  Again, nothing unique (or unreasonable for that matter).
               </p>
               <p>
                  The frustration came in how the official accommodations were written.  They were so vague.  As a result, Mike was able to do a lot of things in class (he was pursuing his interests) that would normally not be allowed during lesson time.  Many of things he did I could tolerate (reading his own book, chatting politics with his neighbor, and even doing yoga in the corner).  But the one major action that annoyed me was that he sometimes played video games on his cell phone!
                  And it's not so much that I was frustrated at the student for playing videio games in class (I'd be lying if I said I wasn't), but that the administration supported this action for "legal" reasons.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I talked to Mike several times about how his actions affected the learning environment.  But that brought about 3 negative consequences: more apathy from Mike, a reprimand from administration, and legal threats from the parents.  I felt as if I was in a no-win situation.  I could see the other students starting to complain about fairness (and who wouldn't), but I could also see that they didn't know who to "blame".  Mike? Me? The administrators? The parents? Nature? Afterall, Mike didn't choose to have a disorder.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In the end, I let Mike play his video games while quietly sitting in the hallway.  This made the parents happy, satisfied the administtrators, and allowed the kids to focus on their lessons.  But I wasn't happy.  I felt powerless to change the situation and embarrassed to call myself a teacher.  What good was I doing the student?  How did my actions help Mike become a better person?  It was too big of a battle for me to handle.  Afterall, I had almost 100 other students to teach, help and accommodate, too.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If I could go back and do something differently, I probably wouldn't.  I think if I would have pushed the issue, I would have been fired by the school and/or sued by the parents.  Taking more time to handle this situation would have meant spending less time helping other students.  I had to make call, and I think I would make the same decision today as I did when I was a younger, more inexperienced person.  What did I learn from this situation?  Education is not always about helping others become better people.  Sometimes, it's about helping to keep everyone else from becoming the ones you couldn't help.
