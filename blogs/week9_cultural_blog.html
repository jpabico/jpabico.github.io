                  According to Professor Anthony Gregorc of the University of Connecticut, we not only have preferred learning styles, but we also have favorite thinking styles.  Apparently, I tend to fall into two camps: CS and AS.  Prof. Gregorc describes concrete sequential thinkers (CS) as those that tend to be based in reality, processing information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.  He describes abstract sequential thinkers (AS) as those that love the wolrd of theory and abstract thought.

                  More specifically, CS thinkers based reality on their physical senses of sight, touch, sound, taste, and smell. They notice, remember, and recall fact easily. Hands-on learning-by-doing is the preferred way of gathering information. On the other hand, AS thinkers like to analyze information and think in concepts.  Such thinkers love to read, prefer working alone, thoroughly researching subjects before beginning.

                  In many ways, these are accurate descriptions of me.  I am a bodily-kinesthetic learner.  I also prefer to work alone more often than in groups.  But that's not to say I don't learn in other ways (visual and audio cues help me a lot) or that I am not a people person (as a former high school teacher, it would have been close to impossible to try to work solo on anything...with the exception of grading, yuck!).

                  I have found pair programming to be immensely productive and beneficial to my understanding of object-oriented programming.  I wouldn't be able to do it all the time, but I wouldn't hesitate to use it to help further my comprehension and abilities as an aspiring developer.  To make the most out of DBC, I need to make sure that I spend my "alone time" when I'm actually alone (e.g. riding to/from home on the train) and spend my "group time" when I'm with my peers on campus.

                  My struggles with Phase 0 don't have so much to do with my learning style as it does with my confidence.  I mean, I know I can do it.  I've tackled several difficult (and seemingly impossible) challenges in my life before.  But trying to start a new career from square one is a daunting task.  Being surrounding with people from all walks of life that have the similar interests and goals can only help me in this endeavor. </p>
