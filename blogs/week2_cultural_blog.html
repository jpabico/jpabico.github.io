               <p>When I think about the times in my life when I've been happiest, several of the words on the list struck a chord.  Among the loudest: adventure, challenge, confidence, friendships, growth, and romance (easy ladies, I'm married).
               </p>
               <p>Of those, <b><em>confidence</em></b> is the most important.  Without it, many of the other values wouldn't have followed for me.  Sometimes, you know you're not the smartest, the bravest, or the most skilled.  But what you may lack in one area, confidence picks up the slack.  It's confidence that allows us to take risks, to take the first steps in overcoming our fears, and to bring us closer to others when we feel alone.
               </p>
               <p>On a scale from 1 (sucks) to 5 (awesome), I would give myself a 4 in how I try to live up to the values above.  It might sound cliche, but I strive to be the best person I can be.  But I also know that there is always room for improvement.
               </p>
               <p>As a teacher, I have many students this time of year excited by their college acceptance letters and uncertain in what the future may hold.  A lot of students come up to me and ask about choosing a major in college.  Though the answer I give to any one particular student is specific, the one common thread of advice I give them - "Live life with no regret."  That usually gives them a pretty good idea.
