                  Massive Open Online Courses (or MOOCs for short) 
                  seem to be the answer to many problems that we 
                  face in society.  But with serveral students in 
                  each online course (often in the tens of thousands), 
                  it's like managing a small metropolitan city, and 
                  some problems get more and more difficult to solve.  
                  Some of the advantages of MOOCs include:
                  <ul>
                     <li> Providing an education in the absence of a 
                        centralized campus.  Some people might not have 
                        the possibility to travel to/from a bricks and 
                        mortar institution
                     </li>
                     <li> Providing a free educations.  Money is not a 
                        problem
                     </li>
                     <li> Developing a global community.  Students get 
                        to meet people from around the world and learn 
                        to understand different cultures through 
                        collaborating with people from other countries.
                     </li>
                     <li> Having the opportunity to chat with some of 
                        the best individuals in various fields.  Whether 
                        it be award-winning musicians, well-travelled 
                        historians, or ground-breaking researchers, 
                        reputable professors from some of the top 
                        universities often teach MOOCs, attracted by the 
                        prospect of sharing their knowledge and findings 
                        with thousands of students at a time online rather 
                        than just a handful in the classroom.
                     </li>
                     <li>  Offering a chance to obtain skills and
                        knowledge to improve career opportunities and
                        job prospects
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                     But despite all these advantages, there is one major 
                     disadvantage that puts a dark shadow over these 
                     benefits: cheating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     How do do ensure that students are doing their own work?  
                     Due to the large number of students, grading becomes 
                     an issue.  Many professors resort to multiple choice 
                     and true/false questions so that grading can be automated
                     and provide timely feedback.  This calls into question
                     the quality of work and depth of understanding of the 
                     students.  Not being able to assess how effective the
                     teaching is makes accreditation for online programs 
                     more difficult to obtain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Cheating can take the form of plagerizing, asking 
                     others to do your work, using unapproved resources 
                     during exams, and registering for the same online 
                     class with two different usernames to gain access 
                     to exams just to name a few.  Are there any means of 
                     preventing cheating?  There have been a few plausible
                     proposals for helping alleviate this problem.  These 
                     include:
                     <ul>
                        <li> Taking tests at approved regional testing 
                           centers (though this might not be convenient 
                           or possible for everyone).
                        </li>
                        <li> Having cameras watch you do your work each
                           you're logged in (insert NSA joke here).
                        </li>
                        <li> Screen Sharing.  This allows proctors to see 
                           in real-time that you're the person actually 
                           doing the work as ait's being done.
                        </li>
                        <li> Supplying photo IDs (though this may raise some
                           identity theft issues)
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     Some people may doubt the effectiveness of the methods 
                     mentioned above, but it's more than is currently done 
                     in physical classrooms (and might very well be more 
                     effective if instituted in a physical classroom).
                  </p>
                  <p> What does future hold for MOOCs?  Nobody can say for 
                     sure.  I don't believe that online degrees will hold 
                     the weight of a degree obtained through a bricks and 
                     mortar institution, at least not anytime soon.  As long 
                     as the issue of cheating is left unresolved, so will 
                     the credibility of an online degree be questioned.
