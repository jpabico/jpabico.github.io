                  Looking back at the blog on values, I wrote about confidence, adventure, friendship, growth and romance.  As far as I'm aware, these values have never really been stereotypically associated with any particular group in the positive or negative sense.  These values are consequences of people's everyday experiences and is sometimes referred to as the human condition.  Generally, these are features that are characteristic of all human beings regardless of race, gender, culture, geography, and socioeconomic status.  For example, people smile and laugh when they're happy; people cry and grieve when a loved one is lost.

                  Granted, the values of which I wrote are developed throughout one's life.  We build confidence, we gain a sense of adventure, we fall in love with people.  Regardless of one's background, it's hard to imagine that any individual (let alone group of individuals) would be incapable of developing such values and emotions while going through life's experiences, good or bad, rich or poor, old or young.  We develop different values or come to understand values differently because the sum of each person's life experiences are different, but the ability for us to potentially understand one another, to sympathize and empathize with the lives of others, is a common thread that ties us all together.
