                  Shereef's analogy of the DBC experience (or "experiment") to that of a kitchen versus a restaurant is an insightful one.  Make your experience, create it!  So often in our lives, we set ourselves to autopilot to get through the day.  Getting through an activity by itself does not constitute an accomplishment and is not necessarily fulfilling at a personal level.  But to be mindful of the experience as it is happening, to participate actively in hopes of affecting the outcome of that experience (for better or for worse) does bring about the sense of achievement and a personal fulfillment.  Immersing yourself in an environment conducive to learning for a few short weeks, surrounded by people from all walks of life with the same goals, motivation and aspirations as yourself, is certainly an opportunity that doesn't come around too often.  When it does, invest in yourself.  Jump into the experience wholeheartedly to learn new skills and develop new levels of confidence.

                  Shereef's discussion on fear struck a strong chord with me.  I've had the thoughts of self-doubt and incompetence, that I might be the "wekest link" in the cohort.  But to realize that it's normal (perhaps expected?) was a big sigh of relief.  It was reassuring to hear him say that "I don't know" is a common phrase at DBC and that it signals an opportunity to learn and master, not a moment of hurt pride or embarrassment.  I have a better sense of what I want to get out of my time at DBC.  It's not just knowledge, meeting new people, and a chance to start a new career.  More importantly, I'll emerge a more confident person.
