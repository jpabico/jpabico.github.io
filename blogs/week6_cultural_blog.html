                  Stereotype threat can be defined as the risk of confirming a 
                  negative stereotype about one's group as self characteristic.  
                  I have been very fortunate in my life to have avoided stereotype 
                  threat for the most part.  Not that stereotyping doesn't come 
                  into my personal life, but the negative ones tend to pass me by.  
                  I am all too aware of the preconceived ideas that surround the 
                  various groups to which I belong.  It's understable why people 
                  tend to have stereotypical ideas.
               </p>
               <p>
                  What kind of person do you think of when I tell you that a person...
                  <ul>
                     <li>was born in the United States</li>
                     <li>studied Philosophy in college</li>
                     <li>taught English in Eastern Europe for 2 years</li>
                  </ul>

                  How about a person that...
                  <ul>
                     <li>lives in California</li>
                     <li>is an Asian-American</li>
                     <li>studied engineering in college</li>
                  </ul>

                  And finally, consider someone that...
                  <ul>
                     <li>played in the high school band</li>
                     <li>likes to read books</li>
                     <li>enjoys singing along with musicals</li>
                  </ul>
                  (If you haven't guess, I'm talking about the same person in all three cases above - ME!!!)
               </p>
               <p> Chances are, you were developing ideas of what "type" of people I was describing because you wanted to understand what "sort" of people could have those interests or characteristics.  Perhaps you even said something like, "I know people like that," or "Hey, that's just like me".  Your mind was trying to fill in the gaps of knowledge that I didn't provide.
               </p>
               <p>Throughout my life, people that have gotten to know me find that I don't easily or neatly "fit" into convenient categories or groups.  But I know that others may not have the luxury of avoiding stereotype threats.  In general, when I meet new people I try to get to know them and learn about their life experiences: where they're from, what they like to do, what their thoughts about the world are, and what keeps them ticking.
               </p>
               <p>By learning more about each individual I meet, I come to reinforce that idea that no two people (let alone a whole group of people) are alike.  Similar in some ways? Sure.  But they are always going to be differenes that make us the unique snowflakes that we are.  As a former educator, I encourage people to try new things and develop their interests.  This is what helps keep the world an interesting and diverse place to live.
