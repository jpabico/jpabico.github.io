Oftem called "the language of the web", Javascript is....  
It would be difficult 
to be a web developer without knowing at least the basics of 
Javascript.  Though it's a matter of preference, many people 
find that it is easier to learn than
some other programming languages like C or Assembly (a 
machine language).  Javascript also has libraries filled with
lots of properties and methods that can be used to interact with
HTML and CSS (the "content" and "presentation" layers of a website").
Many of these libraries account for how different browsers render JS 
code and makes it easier for developers to write programs that will 
work on many browsers.
These libraries can help websites be more interactive with users.
Javascript  is flexible in that it can be used on both the client-side 
and server side (explain lient vs server)
And last, but certainly not least, Javascript so far seems to be fun 
(move sentence about interacting with users here - replace with faster 
processing because of async)
