<p> Three of my favorite sites are zenhabits.net, youtube.com, and ptxofficial.com.  I like them for similar reasons: they provide me with a great user experience.</p>
<p> In particular, each website:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Has interesting content.</b>  I wouldn't be visiting YouTube if I didn't like watching the posted videos or PTX's Official website if I weren't a fan of their music.</li>
	<li><b>Doesn't keep me waiting.</b>  I can't stand it when I click on a link at it take more than 2 seconds for the next screen to upload and be ready (I sound so spoiled!).</li>
	<li><b>Is easy to navigate.</b>  The menu choices are intuitive and easy to find.  I'm not looking around the website, trying to figure out if I've found the right page.  And 5 days later, I can return to the website and easily figure out where I read this article or saw that video.</li>
	<li><b>Is user-friendly.</b>  It doesn't ask me to login if I don't want to.  I don't have to squint my eyes to read the content. The less important content is off to the side or at the bottom of the page.</li>
	<li><b>Is not cluttered with crap.</b>  Sometimes, I run into websites that have so many features on one page, I can't find the one thing that I'm looking for.  To me, this seems typical of college and university websites.  I just want to find my professor's home page, the academic calendar, or the phone number for the library.  Rarely do I find the information so readily. </li>
	<li><b>Have no ads.</b>  I know, this isn't entirely fair because some websites are up and running thanks to their sponsors.  But many ads are distracting and makes it hard for me to concentrate on the website's content.  Instead, I keep looking in the direction of the ad (I think that's their goal - mission accomplished).  OK, Youtube has ads.  At least ads on YouTube appear on the bottom of the video and not in front of it!</li>
